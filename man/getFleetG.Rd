\title{getFleetG - Compute all-site (fleetwide) Evidence of Absence g-value.}
\usage{
getFleetG(siteYearResults, species = "LBBA", weights = NULL,
  yearWeights = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{siteYearResults}{A data frame containing site-season results.
One usually obtains this by running the site-year module of the \code{eoa}
package on
every combination of year and site.  To assist with this, we at WEST have a python app
which copies and pastes the input parameters from CSV files into the
interface of
\code{eoa}.
Once site-year g-values are computed (using the auto-copy-paste routine),
we have a "scraper" function in R which
pulls parameters from all the text files that \code{eoa} produces.
This parameter is a data frame containing the output CSV results
from the "scraper".
At a minimum, \code{siteYearResults} must contain the following
columns:  \code{$species}, \code{$facility}, \code{$gFac.a} = the
alpha paramters of this facility's beta distribution, \code{$gFac.b} =
the beta parameter of this facility's beta distribution, and \code{$year}.}

\item{species}{Species abbreviation to run.}

\item{weights}{A scalar or data frame containing weights for each
facility in the fleet. One row per
facility.  This is the "DWP" field of \code{eoa}. If \code{weights} = NULL,
all facilities receive equal weight.  Otherwise, \code{weights} must be
a data frame containing \code{$facility} and \code{$weight} columns.  This is merged
with \code{siteYearResults} using \code{$facility} as the key. These weights are
re-scaled to sum to 1.0 in the \code{mixtureBeta} function.}

\item{yearWeights}{When more than one year at a facility is present, this
parameter allows different weights to be applied across years.  The length
of this vector must be equal to the number of years of data for all facilities that have
multiple years of data.  That is, an individual facility can have either 1 or length(yearWeights)
rows in siteYearResults.  If yearWeights == NULL, equal weights are use. These
weights are re-scaled to sum to 1.0 inside the \code{mixtureBeta} function.}
}
\value{
The fleet-wide g-value for a particular species.  This
value can then go into \code{estimateL.eoa}.
}
\description{
Compute a single all-site g value from site-season specifice g values.
}
\details{
Seasons are summarized first.  That is, if a site appears more than
once for a species, we assume each line is a separate season
for that species.  g is averaged over those lines first.  At the end,
this average goes into the multi-site g average.

\examples{
syr <- data.frame(species=c("LBBA","LBBA","LBBA"),
   facility=c("f1","f2","f2"),
   gFac.a = c( 69.9299, 63.5035,  84.6997),
   gFac.b = c(  736.4795,  318.3179, 759.9333 ),
   year = c(2015,2015,2016))
